[size=3][b]Why This Exists[/b][/size]

Hey chooms. I got tired of the same old drek — 200+ mods installed locally in Cyberpunk 2077, scattered across a dozen folders, and not a single mod manager out there that could detect them properly. Existing tools just don't sync well with Cyberpunk's mod structure. They can't see what's already on your drive, they can't match your files to Nexus, and half the time you're managing everything by hand like some gonk with a spreadsheet.

So I built RipperMod Manager — a ripperdoc for your mod library. It scans your game folder, figures out which files belong together, links them to their Nexus Mods pages, and gives you full control over everything. AI-powered, Nexus-integrated, and built from the ground up for the Cyberpunk 2077 modding community (though it works with any game on Nexus Mods).

No more guessing which mod broke your game. No more manually tracking 200 mods across folders. Time to chrome up, choom.

[size=3][b]Features[/b][/size]

[b]Mod Scanner & Grouping[/b]
[list]
[*]Automatically scans your game folder and discovers all installed mod files — no matter how many you've got.
[*]Groups scattered files that belong to the same mod using TF-IDF clustering — even when they are spread across multiple directories (mods, archive_mods, red4ext, bin, etc.).
[*]Reads FOMOD and REDmod metadata to improve grouping accuracy.
[*]Streaming progress indicator with phase-by-phase feedback during scans.
[/list]

[b]Auto-Matching (Scan & Correlate)[/b]
This is the preem stuff. RipperMod automatically links your locally installed mods to their Nexus Mods pages using a multi-tier matching pipeline:
[list]
[*][b]Filename ID extraction[/b] — Parses mod IDs embedded in archive filenames.
[*][b]MD5 hash matching[/b] — Matches downloaded archives against Nexus file hashes (gold standard, zero guesswork).
[*][b]Endorsed & Tracked sync[/b] — Cross-references your Nexus endorsed/tracked lists with local files.
[*][b]Fuzzy matching[/b] — Jaccard + Jaro-Winkler similarity scoring as a fallback.
[*][b]AI semantic search[/b] — Optional ChromaDB-powered vector search for the hardest-to-match mods (requires OpenAI API key).
[*]Displays a confidence score on every match so you know how reliable it is.
[*]Deduplication ensures only the best match per Nexus mod is kept.
[/list]

[b]Match Review Actions[/b]
The algorithm does the heavy lifting, but you're the one calling the shots:
[list]
[*][b]Accept / Confirm[/b] — Approve an automatic match with one click.
[*][b]Reject[/b] — Remove an incorrect match so the mod can be re-matched.
[*][b]Correct / Reassign[/b] — Manually search for the right Nexus mod by name, paste a Nexus URL, or enter a mod ID directly.
[/list]

[size=3][b]How to Install[/b][/size]

[b]1.[/b] Download the latest installer from the [b]Files[/b] tab on this page.
[b]2.[/b] Run the installer and follow the prompts.
[b]3.[/b] Launch RipperMod Manager from your Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

That's it — no additional software required. Everything is bundled in the installer. Future updates are delivered automatically through the app, so you're always running the latest version.

[size=3][b]How to Use[/b][/size]

[b]Step 1: First Launch (Onboarding)[/b]
The app walks you through a quick setup:

[list=1]
[*][b]Nexus Mods Login[/b] — Sign in with your Nexus Mods account via the official SSO flow.
[*][b]Game Setup[/b] — Point the app to your game install folder. For Cyberpunk 2077, it auto-detects Steam, GOG, and Epic installs.
[*][b]Initial Scan[/b] — The app scans your game folder and discovers your installed mods.
[/list]

[b]Step 2: Review Your Mods[/b]
After scanning, your mods are grouped and organized. The app automatically matches them with their Nexus Mods pages so you can see descriptions, versions, and authors. You can [b]Accept[/b], [b]Reject[/b], or [b]Correct[/b] any match.

[b]Tip for better Scan & Correlate results[/b]
For best results, endorse the mods you have installed on Nexus Mods. Tracked mods also help, but the matching pipeline has been tested most extensively with endorsed mods. A quick way to improve matching: review your download history on Nexus and endorse the mods you currently have installed.

[b]Step 3: Manage Your Mods[/b]

[list]
[*][b]Install[/b] — Use the built-in download manager or the Archives tab. FOMOD archives get a full installer wizard.
[*][b]Update[/b] — Check the Updates tab to see which mods have newer versions, then download with one click.
[*][b]Toggle[/b] — Enable or disable any mod without uninstalling it.
[*][b]Profiles[/b] — Save your current setup as a profile and switch between different mod loadouts. Export and share profiles as JSON.
[*][b]Endorse & Track[/b] — Manage your Nexus endorsements and tracking directly from the app.
[/list]
